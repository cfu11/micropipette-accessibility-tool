## Problem
Standard micropipettes require repetitve motion and prolonged grip strength, limiting accessibility for users with motor impairments and musculoskeletal disorders.

## Approach
- Conducted stakeholder interviews with a user with a motor impairment
- Translated qualitative needs into design constraints
- Iterated through CAD prototypes
- Validated designs through user feedback

## Tools
SolidWorks · Onshape · 3D Printing · User Research
